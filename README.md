## Shiny app
You can find the way to my Shiny app through [this link](https://rogerylo.shinyapps.io/DrinkDecider/).

## Features
This app shows alcohol options based on:
- Your preferred price range
- Your preferred alcohol content
- Your preferred alcohol type
- The country of origin

The options are displayed in a plot and a table. You can hover on a point in the plot to see more information about that particular option.

In addition, if you feel decision-fatigued, just check the *Let fate decide!* box, and we'll randomly give you one drink!

## Files
If you'd like to see the original `.R` file used to generate the app, please go [here](hw08.R).
